Notes:

- a project of this size would probably not use redux, as it's overkill - however I'm using it here to showcase my skills.
- The data is mocked, normally it'd be done using Redux Saga. I'm skipping it in this case (as per specification)
- I'm using the latest as of the time of writing version of react, 16.8, including hooks. 
- the tests are done using react-testing-library. A simple test, checking validation and a happy path.
- I'm using flow for type checking. The entire codebase is flow-compliant.
- I'm using semantic-ui as a css framework, plus a basic css import in one case.
- the validation is a bit clumsy, normally I'd use redux-form, but that's a complete overkill in this case.
